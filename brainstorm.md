Download directory structure:

Reader
- Dedicated second window

How to tell if a chapter was downloaded already
- Source matters. Same manga on different sources are treated differently. They might have differing image qualities, one might be ahead of the other, etc.
- Upon clicking into a manga to view its chapters, try to match source, manga title, then chapter titles to see if anything has already been downloaded.
- If already downloaded, offer to redownload (maybe the user deleted some pages by accident)

Favorites
- Save favorites by just copying its Manga object to favorites.json
- The favorites page simply displays the saved Manga objects instead of fetching and creating new ones from online.
- "Chapter downloaded already?" check logic will work as usual
- A favorite's cover image, title, and blurb should always be accessible offline
- Each of favorite's chapters can either be offline or online. When offline, only the downloaded chapters will appear.
- User should NOT have to favorite a manga to download its chapters
- Favorites and downloads must be in two separate locations

Most natural solution:
- Default download path is "downloads/" inside app folder
- User can change download path, i.e. "C:/Users/andre/Manga"
- Favorites information is always inside app folder
- 

Storing favorites:
- favorites.json
- In same folder as executable to make it easy to find
{
  favorites: [
    {
      
    }
  ]  
}
