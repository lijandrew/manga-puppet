## **Why?**

Many scrapers and downloaders consist of crammed buttons, text lists, and configurations that some may find overwhelming. Manga Puppet is made **with consideration for newcomers to manga downloading**, or really, anyone who would like a **more visually-pleasing experience**. Manga Puppet aims to be a sleek, accessible, and user-friendly option that sacrifices a little more bandwidth usage and some extra clicks in return for a richer browsing experience (cover images, manga descriptions, etc.) and easier-to-navigate interface.
